===============================================================================
WHAT I DID
-> I deleted the login and register fragments and the database
-> I backed up the code so don't worry if anything goes wrong
-> REMEMBER to back up yourself also when you reach a checkpoint XD

===============================================================================
YOUR QUEST
-> For now, you may test the login thing at the RestaurantActivity, line 62
-> If can, do implement where if user is logged in, isLoggedIn = true
-> Fix some bugs and glitches if any
===============================================================================
MISC
-> Any questions about my code don't hesitate to ask me!
-> Need any help don't hesitate to ask me! But I'm not super genius also yea xD
===============================================================================
WHAT I WILL DO IN THE MEANTIME
-> I think I will work on the navigation bar, where I'll add 3 icons:
(A) Home button (go back to main activity)
(B) Checkout button (go to checkout screen)
(C) View order history button (View logged in customer order history)
